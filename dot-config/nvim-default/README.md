# dotfiles-nvim

Well hellor there!

It's been a while ...

This is my neovim configuration.
It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about neovim and vimscript.

Everything you see here is based on the awesome stuff you can find in:

- [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim (github.com)](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

## Paths

- **Windows** -- `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim`
- **Linux** -- `$HOME/.config/nvim`

## Features

- This actually works on Windows :)
  (still can't believe it I suffer from Windows but get to enjoy a proper VIM setup)

## TODO

- [ ] As everyone, including myself, uses devcontainters,
      figure out how to make this work with devcontainers
